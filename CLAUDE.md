# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Akhil S, an AI Product Manager specializing in healthcare technology and media AI. It's a static website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Architecture

- **Static Site**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript without build tools or frameworks
- **Single Page**: Main content in `index.html`
- **Styling**: External stylesheet `styles.css` (to be created)
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript in `script.js` (to be created)
- **Deployment**: Designed for GitHub Pages

## Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start local development (opens index.html in browser)
npm start

# Deploy changes to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### File Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with portfolio content
- `styles.css` - CSS styling (referenced but not yet created)
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality (referenced but not yet created)
- `favicon.ico` - Site favicon (referenced but not yet created)

## Key Development Notes

1. **Missing Files**: The project references `styles.css`, `script.js`, and `favicon.ico` which need to be created
2. **Static Deployment**: This is intended as a static site for GitHub Pages deployment
3. **SEO Ready**: HTML includes meta tags for SEO and Open Graph social sharing
4. **Portfolio Focus**: Content centers on AI product management, healthcare tech, and digital transformation experience
